# Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) + Learning Vault

This vault merges a Personal Knowledge Base structure with a focused learning workflow. It's designed for multidisciplinary learners who want to balance deep understanding with practical knowledge application.

## Directory Overview

### `00-Meta/`
Cross-cutting organizational files:
- `Project-Roadmap.md`: Track active, future, and completed learning or work projects.
- `Weekly-Review.md`: Reflect on your learning week-by-week.
- `Reading-List.md`: Curate articles, books, papers, or documentation to consume later.

### `01-Projects/`
Real-world projects, codebases, or long-term initiatives you’re actively working on.

### `02-Knowledge/`
Distilled, long-term notes across broad domains (e.g., Finance, Computer Science, Maths). These are *reference-grade* notes, often extracted from working or learning sessions.

### `03-Learning/`
A learning system organized around active intake, knowledge distillation, and spaced review.

#### `03-Learning/00-Meta/`
A roadmap for learning goals (e.g., “HTB: Web Exploitation”, “Term 2 ML Math Recap”).

#### `03-Learning/01-Working/`
Rough session notes from watching lectures, working through books, completing HTB boxes, etc.
- Captures questions, confusions, examples, partial understandings.
- Low friction, high velocity.

#### `03-Learning/02-Reference/`
Clear, accurate, curated notes based on working sessions. Think of this as your "personal textbook."

#### `03-Learning/03-Journal/`
Daily learning scratchpad, reflections, tangents, or things that don’t yet have a place.

## `Templates/`
Reusable markdown templates for:
- Learning sessions
- Reference notes
- Weekly reviews

Templates support your learning cycle:
1. Fast intake → `Session-Template.md`
2. Structured understanding → `Reference-Note-Template.md`
3. Reflection and review → `Weekly-Review-Template.md`

## How to Use This Vault

1. **Begin any learning session** with `Session-Template.md`. Don't worry about neatness—focus on speed and clarity.
2. **Extract the best insights** into clean files in `03-Learning/02-Reference/`.
3. **Review regularly** via `Weekly-Review.md` or skim through your scratchpad and working notes.
4. **Evolve your PKB** over time by moving the most foundational knowledge into `02-Knowledge/`.

Use consistent tagging and metadata like:
- `#topic/machine-learning`, `#status/in-progress`, `discipline::cybersec`
- `review::weekly`, `source::HTB`, `project::algo-docgen`

## Sync + Version Control Tips

- Use Obsidian Sync or Git to keep everything backed up.
- Use the Advanced URI plugin to jump between notes with deep links.
- Periodically prune or archive old working notes to keep things clean.

Happy learning.
